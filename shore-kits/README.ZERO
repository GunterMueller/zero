-Prepare shore-kits source directory

We don't want to build shore-kits under the projects/Zero/shore-kits as
this will pollute the git tree with files created by automake.
Instead we suggest to create a local copy of the shore-kits tree and build 
that. 

cp -r ~/projects/Zero/shore-kits <local-shore-kits>

-Build shore-kits

cd <local-shore-kits>
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-shore6 --enable-debug(optional) 
make -j
